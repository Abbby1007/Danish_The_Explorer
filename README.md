Information:
This Project was made for Hack Clubs Athena event
It was inspired by a google slide show i made while bored in Chemistry class. (10th grade)
The slide show was about a Danish explorer who saves a bagel village from Donut wizards.
This Game only has Danish the Explorer and the donut wizards.
Danish the Explorer is inspired by Indiana Jones and Dora the Explorer

I made this because I have always wanted to make a game and now I can say I have
I struggled with staying motivated, designing the player and enemy, while also struggling to get use to Godot.

Credit:
The player and enemy sprites were made by me (Abigail Loken)
all other sprites were made by "Game Endeavor" on Itch.io
I followed DevWorm' s RPG Godot 4 tutorial for main mechanics

Took about 10 hours of Godot programming and about 2 areas of sprite craeting in aesprite
